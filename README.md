# How To Alias

As with most things git related, there is more than one way to do this, and it also probably differs over time/version/distro/OS/...

## Bash Aliases

My first simple way to create shell aliases for git commands.  Simply define as bash aliases in the usual way.

## Git Aliases

Ref the https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases book you can create a new alias with a git config command.
The ping notation allows for running an external command instead of git.  Some git alias authors use this to invoke git indirectly.

## How to use this repo

If you prefer to use bash aliases, then source bash-git-aliases from your bashrc file.

If you prefer to use git aliases then source git-aliases once and it will change your global git config file.

Edit either, mix and match.

## Liability Warning

Use these aliases with care.  I take no responsibility for any damage you do to your own repositories as a consequence of following this.

Remember - git almost never loses data, an expert can help, and real backups are made by uploading your code to an ftp server.
